# J.I.S.O.O.
This is a modded version of Windows 10 called J.I.S.O.O. made with NTLite. It's 64bit only and has some tweaks and installed programs like deactivated Microsoft Account and some cosmetic things like a pink color scheme.

The name J.I.S.O.O. comes from Kim Ji-soo of the korean girlgroup BLACKPINK. I mean why should I use a normal name when I can use the name of a cute girl. Btw I will continue to use the BLACKPINK naming and color scheme.
